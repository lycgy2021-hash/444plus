# AI Research Plane (S1–S3)

This is an **additive** plane beside the deterministic detection plane, not a
rewrite of it. The detection base — `--discover`, fingerprint, assessment cache,
the CVE checker contract, `not_found/detected/likely/confirmed` + `unknown/error`,
the FP corpus, the protocol probes — is **frozen** and authoritative. The research
plane only proposes leads and hands them to deterministic validators.

```

## The one rule: AI ≠ Authority

- `ai.Provider.Analyze` returns `AnalysisResult`, which has **no** verdict / state
  / severity / "confirmed" field. A model cannot express a decision through it;
  unknown JSON keys (a model inventing `"verdict":"confirmed"`) are dropped on
  unmarshal.
- `research.Analyzer` turns proposals into `research.Candidate`s **only** at
  `Hypothesis`, tagged with their AI origin (provider name recorded).
- `Candidate.Promote` advances one rung at a time and **requires a named
  (deterministic) validator plus justifying evidence**. A Provider has neither, so
  it can never move a candidate past `Hypothesis`. There is no method anywhere
  that converts a `Candidate` into a detection `Verdict`.
- `Evidence` is truth; the model reasons over facts, never raw dumps.

## What landed

**S1 — `internal/ai/`** (generic gateway; imports neither the detection plane nor
`research`, so it has no verdict vocabulary and no import cycle):
- `provider.go` — the `Provider` interface (the only seam to any model backend).
- `openai_compat.go` — one OpenAI-compatible implementation that serves local
  vLLM / llama.cpp / KoboldCpp / Ollama and cloud alike (only BaseURL/Model/APIKey
  differ). Uses stdlib `net/http`, deliberately **not** `internal/httpx` (the model
  endpoint is infrastructure, not a scan target under the policy allowlist).
- `schema.go` — `Task`, `AnalysisRequest` (payload as opaque JSON), `AnalysisResult`
  / `Proposal` (propose + name gaps only).
- `prompt.go` — the standing system prompt that states the authority boundary.
- `budget.go` — `Budget`/`Tracker` (request/token/wall-clock/USD caps; zero = no
  limit, since local models are free).

**S2 — `research/evidence.go`** — model-consumable structured facts:
`Observation` (product/protocol facts, bounded request/response, `NetworkAction`
that is read-only/probe, never "exploit"), `Evidence`, and `FromModelEvidence`, the
one-way adapter that derives research evidence from a frozen `model.Evidence`.

**S3 — `research/candidate.go`** — `State` ladder (`hypothesis → reproducible →
impact_confirmed → vendor_confirmed → cve_assigned`), `Candidate`, `NewHypothesis`
(the only entry point), and `Promote` (the deterministic-validator gate).
`research/analyzer.go` is the minimal glue proving the boundary end to end.

Nothing here touches the 28 checkers or the engine; `go build/vet/test ./...`
stays green.

## Roadmap (not in this change)

`S4` AI Finding Analyst · `S5` `Validator` interface (the authority that promotes
candidates) · `S6` Diff Analyzer · `S7` Source-audit ingestion · `S8` Fuzz/crash
pipeline · `S9` Differential engine · `S10` State-machine explorer. Each is a new
**Research Source** feeding the same `Candidate → Validator → Evidence` spine.
